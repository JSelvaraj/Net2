# Resource Discovery and Messaging App

For this project we were given a skeleton GUI. We had to make that GUI to display other users on a network (using UDP discovery). 

If those other users were following a predifined messaging protocol, the program allows the user to send and receive text messages to and from these other users over a TCP connection.
